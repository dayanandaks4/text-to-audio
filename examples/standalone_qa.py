    "what is artificial intelligence": """
    Artificial Intelligence, commonly known as AI, is a revolutionary field of computer science 
    that focuses on creating intelligent machines capable of performing tasks that typically 
    require human intelligence.
    
    AI systems can learn from experience, adapt to new inputs, and perform human-like tasks 
    such as recognizing speech, making decisions, solving problems, and understanding natural language.
    
    The field encompasses various technologies including machine learning, deep learning, 
    natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.
    
    AI is transforming industries from healthcare and finance to transportation and entertainment, 
    making our lives more efficient and opening new possibilities for innovation.
    """,
    
    "what is ai": """
    AI stands for Artificial Intelligence. It represents cutting-edge technology that enables 
    computers and machines to simulate human intelligence and cognitive functions.
    
    AI systems can learn, reason, perceive, and make decisions. They process vast amounts of data 
    to identify patterns, make predictions, and solve complex problems that would normally require 
    human thinking.
    
    Modern AI includes machine learning algorithms that improve automatically through experience, 
    neural networks that mimic the human brain, and sophisticated programs that can understand 
    and generate human language.
    
    AI is already integrated into many aspects of our daily lives, from smartphone assistants 
    to recommendation systems on streaming platforms.
    """,
    
    "what is machine learning": """
    Machine Learning is a powerful subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers 
    to automatically learn, improve, and make decisions from data without being explicitly 
    programmed for every specific task.
    
    The core concept revolves around algorithms that can identify patterns in large datasets 
    and use these patterns to make predictions or classifications on new, unseen data.
    
    There are three main types of machine learning: supervised learning, where algorithms learn 
    from labeled examples; unsupervised learning, where systems find hidden patterns in unlabeled 
    data; and reinforcement learning, where programs learn through interaction and feedback.
    
    Machine learning powers many technologies we use daily, including recommendation systems 
    on streaming platforms, email spam filters, voice recognition, and predictive text.
    """,
    
    "what is python": """
    Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that has become one of the most 
    popular and versatile programming languages in the world.
    
    Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python emphasizes code readability 
    and simplicity. The language is designed with a clear, intuitive syntax that makes it easy 
    to learn for beginners while remaining powerful enough for expert programmers.
    
    Python is widely used across numerous fields including web development, data science, 
    artificial intelligence, machine learning, automation, and scientific computing.
    
    Popular applications include web frameworks like Django and Flask, data analysis libraries 
    like Pandas and NumPy, and machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.

    "how does text to speech work": """
    Text-to-speech technology, also known as TTS, is a fascinating process that converts written 
    text into natural-sounding spoken words using advanced artificial intelligence and signal 
    processing techniques.
    
    The process begins with text analysis, where the system examines the written content to 
    understand punctuation, abbreviations, and context. Next, linguistic processing determines 
    proper pronunciation, stress patterns, and intonation.
    
    Modern TTS systems use neural networks and deep learning models to generate high-quality, 
    human-like speech. These systems are trained on hours of human speech data to learn natural 
    speaking patterns, rhythm, and emotional expression.
    
    The final step involves audio synthesis, where the processed information is converted into 
    sound waves that create the audible speech output you hear.

    "what can you do": """
    I am a comprehensive question-answering system designed to provide detailed, educational 
    responses about technology, computer science, and artificial intelligence topics.
    
    My capabilities include answering questions about artificial intelligence concepts, explaining 
    how various technologies work, describing programming languages and their applications, and 
    providing insights into machine learning and data science topics.
    
    I convert all my text responses into audio using text-to-speech technology, making information 
    accessible through both reading and listening. This is particularly valuable for people who 
    prefer auditory learning.
    
    I provide comprehensive, detailed answers rather than brief responses, ensuring you get 
    thorough explanations that help you truly understand complex topics.

    "is the audio working": """
    Yes, the audio system is designed to work correctly. The system converts text answers into 
    speech using text-to-speech technology.
    
    Each time you ask a question, the system generates a comprehensive text response and then 
    attempts to convert that response into audible speech.
    
    The audio files are created and can be played through your computer's audio system. If you're 
    not hearing audio, please check your computer's volume settings and ensure your speakers or 
    headphones are properly connected.
    
    The system creates clear, spoken versions of all text answers to make the information more 
    accessible and easier to understand.
