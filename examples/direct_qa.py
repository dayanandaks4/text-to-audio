    "what is artificial intelligence": """Artificial Intelligence, commonly known as AI, is a revolutionary field of computer science that focuses on creating intelligent machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI systems can learn from experience, adapt to new inputs, and perform human-like tasks such as recognizing speech, making decisions, solving problems, and understanding natural language. The field encompasses various technologies including machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. AI is transforming industries from healthcare and finance to transportation and entertainment, making our lives more efficient and opening new possibilities for innovation and human advancement.""",
    
    "what is ai": """AI stands for Artificial Intelligence. It represents the cutting-edge technology that enables computers and machines to simulate human intelligence and cognitive functions. AI systems can learn, reason, perceive, and make decisions. They process vast amounts of data to identify patterns, make predictions, and solve complex problems that would normally require human thinking. Modern AI includes machine learning algorithms that improve automatically through experience, neural networks that mimic the human brain, and sophisticated programs that can understand and generate human language. AI is already integrated into many aspects of our daily lives, from smartphone assistants to recommendation systems, and continues to evolve rapidly.""",
    
    "how does text to speech work": """Text-to-speech technology, also known as TTS, is a fascinating process that converts written text into natural-sounding spoken words using advanced artificial intelligence and signal processing techniques. The process begins with text analysis, where the system examines the written content to understand punctuation, abbreviations, and context. Next, linguistic processing determines proper pronunciation, stress patterns, and intonation. Modern TTS systems use neural networks and deep learning models to generate high-quality, human-like speech. These systems are trained on hours of human speech data to learn natural speaking patterns, rhythm, and emotional expression. The final step involves audio synthesis, where the processed information is converted into sound waves that create the audible speech output you hear.""",
    
    "what is machine learning": """Machine Learning is a powerful subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to automatically learn, improve, and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed for every specific task. The core concept revolves around algorithms that can identify patterns in large datasets and use these patterns to make predictions or classifications on new, unseen data. Think of it as teaching a computer to recognize trends and relationships in information, much like how humans learn from experience. There are three main types of machine learning: supervised learning, where algorithms learn from labeled examples; unsupervised learning, where systems find hidden patterns in unlabeled data; and reinforcement learning, where programs learn through interaction and feedback. Machine learning powers many technologies we use daily, including recommendation systems, email filters, voice recognition, and predictive text.""",
    
    "what is python": """Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that has become one of the most popular and versatile programming languages in the world. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python emphasizes code readability and simplicity. The language is designed with a clear, intuitive syntax that makes it easy to learn for beginners while remaining powerful enough for expert programmers. Python follows the philosophy of making code readable and requiring fewer lines of code compared to other programming languages. Python is widely used across numerous fields including web development, data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, automation, scientific computing, and software development. Its extensive ecosystem of libraries and frameworks makes it incredibly versatile for solving various problems.""",
    
    "how do neural networks work": """Neural networks are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks found in animal brains. They represent one of the most significant breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and machine learning. A neural network consists of interconnected nodes, called artificial neurons or perceptrons, organized in layers. Information flows from input layers through hidden layers to output layers. Each connection between neurons has an associated weight that determines the strength of the signal. The learning process involves adjusting these weights based on training data. When the network makes incorrect predictions, an algorithm called backpropagation updates the weights to minimize errors and improve accuracy over time. Deep neural networks, with multiple hidden layers, can learn complex patterns and representations from data. This capability enables them to excel at tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, speech recognition, and game playing.""",
    
    "what can you do": """I am a comprehensive AI-powered question-answering system designed to provide detailed, educational responses about technology, computer science, and artificial intelligence topics. My capabilities include answering questions about artificial intelligence concepts, explaining how various technologies work, describing programming languages and their applications, and providing insights into machine learning and data science topics. I can convert all my text responses into high-quality audio using advanced text-to-speech technology, making information accessible through both reading and listening. The system provides comprehensive, detailed answers rather than brief responses, ensuring you get thorough explanations that help you truly understand complex topics. I can handle questions about topics ranging from basic programming concepts to advanced AI techniques.""",
    
    "is the audio working": """Yes, the audio generation system is working correctly and has been successfully tested. The system uses advanced neural text-to-speech technology to convert written answers into high-quality audio files. Each time you ask a question, the system processes your query, generates a comprehensive text response, and then converts that response into natural-sounding speech audio. The audio files are saved in WAV format at 16kHz quality, which provides clear and crisp sound. The audio generation process involves sophisticated AI models that have been trained on human speech patterns to create natural intonation, proper pronunciation, and appropriate pacing. All generated audio files are automatically saved in the output directory with descriptive filenames, making them easy to locate and replay.""",
